For our first mid-month event of 2026 we hope to be planting approximately 10 metres of hedgerow from the corner of the Eaves playground down the road to where the wall starts. This will be to increase biodiversity, reduce the footprint of invasivae species (Himalayan Balsam) and continue the hawthorn hedge from the park.

We are also planning to lay the existing hawthorn hedge in order to rejuvenate it and create a more effective barrier to the steep sloping land leading to the emergence of Colden Water from the tunnel under the playground. This will also create a vital wildlife corridor with food and shelter for birds, mammals, and insects, connecting fragmented habitats and supporting biodiversity, while also acting as a windbreak and helping carbon capture.
