Meeting in Eaves Playground at 10am on the first Sunday of every month, we are a friendly community volunteer group carrying out nature restoration work, including woodland management and invasive species removal, in the ancient woodland of Colden Clough.

Young or old, everyone is welcome – we hope to see you there!
