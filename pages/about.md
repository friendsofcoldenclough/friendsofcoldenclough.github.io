Colden Clough is a landscape rich in history and has a multitude of paths meandering amongst old chimneys, temperate rainforest and stunning views. Ancient woodland covers just 2.4% of the UK so we are incredibly lucky to live in an area with such a special place right on our doorstep.

Caring for Colden Clough feels like a great way of giving something back for all that we enjoy and that’s why the Friends of Colden Clough was set up.

Meeting at 10am on the first Sunday of every month in Eaves Playground, we are a friendly group of people seeking to understand and actively look after the area in a variety of ways. Young or old, everyone is welcome to get involved.

To be kept in the loop with more information, email [friendscoldenclough@gmail.com](mailto:friendscoldenclough@gmail.com) or join our Facebook group ([Friends of Colden Clough](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3797294470486573/)).

We are financially supported by the Rotary Club of Hebden Bridge and Heptonstall Parish Council.
