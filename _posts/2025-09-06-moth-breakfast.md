Andrew Cockcroft of Halifax Scientific Society came to look at the moth population of the clough with us.

It's called a moth breakfast because he left a light box overnight and then came along in the morning and see which moths we had.

Unfortunately, there were only a few moths in the box in the morning, so Andrew will return in the spring. We still met on the park, and went on a walk around the clough, led by Robin.
