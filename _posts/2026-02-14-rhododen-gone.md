This is the first of our mid-month work days. We will be meeting on the third Saturday of each month in addition to the first Sunday from March 2026 onwards.

Meeting in Eaves Playground at 10am, we will be clearing some large and small rhododendron from the Clough, near to Hell Hole rocks. This was so much fun in October, November and December that we decided to do it again!
