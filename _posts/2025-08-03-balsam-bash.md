Our last two events on [July 6th]({% link _posts/2025-07-06-balsam-bash.md %}) and [June 1st ]({% link _posts/2025-06-01-balsam-bash.md %})were also Balsam bashes - there is a large amount of Himalayan Balsam in Colden Clough, and despite repeated attempts to stem its spread throughout the valley it continues to thrive.
