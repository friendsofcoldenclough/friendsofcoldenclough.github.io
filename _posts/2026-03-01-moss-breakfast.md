Join us on a gentle walk with local ecologist and bryologist Johnny Turner to explore the incredible diversity of mosses and liverworts of this special place.
<!--more-->
Johnny has been studying the bryophytes of the Clough for many years [and recorded nearly 200 species here]({% link pages/colden-clough-bryophytes-2016.md %})!

We’ll be exploring a variety of habitats and discussing the importance of these tiny (and some not so tiny) plants and what they can tell us about environmental conditions.

We will start at 10am at Eaves Playground and walk up to Jack Bridge up the main track on the Colden side with the occasional detour, so please wear sturdy footwear and clothing suitable for the weather.

No previous knowledge of bryophytes required. Some 10x lenses will be available for use, but please bring one if you have one.

A voluntary donation at the end of the walk would be welcomed!
