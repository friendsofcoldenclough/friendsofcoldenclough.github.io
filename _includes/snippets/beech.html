It grows in woods or as single trees, usually on drier, free-draining soils, such as chalk, limestone and light loams.</p>

<p>Beech woodland is shady and characterised by a dense carpet of fallen leaves and mast husks which prevent most woodland plants from growing. Only specialist shade-tolerant plants can survive beneath a beech canopy.</p>

<p>Thinning the beech saplings in areas of woodland will allow native species such as <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/a-z-of-british-trees/english-oak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oak</a>, <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/a-z-of-british-trees/silver-birch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">silver birch</a>, <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/a-z-of-british-trees/downy-birch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">downy birch</a> and <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/a-z-of-british-trees/rowan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rowan</a> to thrive where beech would otherwise take over.</p>
